S'There was a young lady named Bright,\rWho traveled much faster than light.\rShe started one day\rIn a relative way,\rAnd returned the previous night.\r\rTo her friends said the Bright one in chatter,\r"I have learned something new about matter:\rAs my speed was so great\rMuch increased was my weight,\rYet I failed to become any fatter!"'
