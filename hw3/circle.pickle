S'A circle is a thing of cold perfection.\rGiven the chance, a circle will go far,\rBut not in any definite direction,\rAnd never more or less than two Pi r.\r\rIts impulses are never quite wholehearted.\rIt starts, but like a traveler ill-prepared,\rIt soon comes back again to where it started,\rHaving enclosed a space for Pi r squared.'
